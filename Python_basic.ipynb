        "1.  What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and vast library support.\n",
        "Popularity reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Easy to learn & read (English-like syntax)\n",
        "\n",
        " - Large standard library and third-party modules\n",
        "\n",
        " - Cross-platform compatibility\n",
        "\n",
        " - Versatile — used in web dev, data science, automation, AI, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "-  An interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "-  Keywords are reserved words with special meaning in Python (e.g., if, for, while, True). They cannot be used as identifiers (variable names).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "-  No, keywords are reserved and cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "-  Mutability means the ability of an object’s content to be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  List: Designed for dynamic data, allowing modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Tuple: Used for fixed data storage, ensuring data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  Difference between == and is operators in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  == → Checks value equality (whether values are the same).\n",
        "\n",
        "-  is → Checks identity (whether both refer to the same object in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  and → True if both operands are True.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  or → True if at least one operand is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  not → Inverts the boolean value.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.   What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "-  Converting a variable from one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  Difference between implicit and explicit type casting:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Implicit: Done automatically by Python (e.g., int to float).\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Explicit: Manually done using functions like int(), float().\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  Purpose of conditional statements in Python:\n",
        "-  To control program flow based on certain conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "-   Checks another condition if the previous if/elif condition is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  Difference between for and while loops:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  for loop: Iterates over a sequence (known range).\n",
        "\n",
        "-  while loop: Runs until a condition becomes false.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Scenario where while is more suitable:\n",
        "-   When the number of iterations is unknown beforehand — e.g., reading user input until they type \"exit\"."
